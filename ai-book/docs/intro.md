# Welcome to the AI RAG Book

We are living in a time where Artificial Intelligence can read, write, explain, and even teach. But one of the most powerful abilities of modern AI is something called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

This book teaches you how to build an AI system that can read a book and answer questions about it.

By the end of this book you will understand how to:

• Build a documentation website using Docusaurus  
• Convert text into AI embeddings  
• Store knowledge in a vector database  
• Build a RAG chatbot using FastAPI + OpenAI  
• Embed the chatbot directly inside a website  

This book is not just theory — it is a **hands-on project**.

You are building a real AI product while reading this.
