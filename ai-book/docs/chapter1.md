# Chapter 1 — Understanding Artificial Intelligence

Before building our AI system, we must understand the basics.

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science of building machines that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.

Examples:
• Understanding language  
• Recognizing images  
• Making decisions  
• Answering questions  

Modern AI systems are powered by **Machine Learning**.

## Machine Learning vs Traditional Programming

Traditional programming:

Input → Rules → Output

Machine Learning:

Input → Data → Learned Rules → Output

Instead of writing rules manually, we let the computer **learn patterns from data**.

## What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

NLP is a branch of AI that allows computers to understand human language.

Examples:
• ChatGPT  
• Google Translate  
• Voice assistants  

Our chatbot will use NLP to:
• Understand questions  
• Search knowledge  
• Generate answers

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs are AI models trained on massive amounts of text.

They learn:
• Grammar  
• Facts  
• Reasoning patterns  

Examples:
• GPT models  
• Claude  
• Gemini  

However, LLMs have a problem…

They don’t know your private data.

This leads us to the next chapter.
